"""Crash oracle for OUR build: arm a Frida exception handler on the live game so a
silent cast-time crash (window vanishes = unhandled access violation) is caught
with a symbolized EBP backtrace BEFORE the process dies.

This is the permanent promotion of the throwaway tmp_crash_catch.py that caught the
two Fireball crashes (abort-on-cast 11ef54f6, UAF 0xDDDDDDDD 1ac84b92). The lesson
those bugs taught: parity GREEN + a Frida trace on the *original* is not enough --
nothing exercised our recovered code on our own build, so cast-time faults shipped
as "done". `vm.sh smoke` arms this guard while you drive the recovered path.

Channel: print to stdout. Run as a host-side background ssh child
(`ssh win11vm python scripts/frida_crash_guard.py <pid>`); its stdout returns over
ssh reliably -- unlike the vm.sh-frida VBS payload, whose VM-side file writes are
dropped once the parent exits. Attach BY PID (from the running iwd2-re.exe), not by
spawning ptr(0x400000) hooks. Stays alive until the crash (or until killed).

  python scripts/frida_crash_guard.py <pid|name>     # default target: iwd2-re.exe
  python scripts/frida_crash_guard.py <pid> --count CGameSprite::Render

--count also answers the OTHER half of the question. "No fault for 90s" does not
distinguish "the recovered code is correct" from "the recovered code never ran",
and that gap is exactly what let both Fireball crashes ship past parity GREEN.
Counting entries to the recovered symbol turns an idle smoke into a real gate,
and it needs no source change -- we are already attached and already symbolizing.

Exit / output contract (parsed by vm.sh smoke):
  "ARMED"                  -> handler installed, safe to drive the feature
  "########## EXCEPTION ..."-> a fault fired; the block that follows is the backtrace
  "########## DETACHED"    -> target went away (crash death or normal close)
  "INSTRUMENTED <sym> <n>" -> --count resolved <sym> to n address(es)
  "NOT_INSTRUMENTED <sym>" -> --count resolved <sym> to nothing (inlined? folded
                              by /OPT:ICF? wrong name?) -- a caller MUST treat
                              this as a failure, never as a silent pass
  "HITS <sym> <n>"         -> entry count, re-emitted every 2s. Periodic, not
                              on teardown, because vm.sh kills this process and
                              a teardown handler would never run.
