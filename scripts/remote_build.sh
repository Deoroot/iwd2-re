# Host -> VM build/run orchestrator for iwd2-re.
# Editing + Claude Code + re-agent live on the CachyOS host; the build (VS2019/MFC) and the
# game run on the Win11 VM, driven over SSH (alias `win11vm`, localhost:2222, key auth).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/remote_build.sh            # sync + build only
#   scripts/remote_build.sh --run      # sync + build + deploy + launch in session 1 (renders),
#                                      #   then poll for world activation. Game stays up for Frida.
#
# Why .cmd batches instead of inline `ssh win11vm cmd /c "..."`:
#   - the VM's default SSH shell is PowerShell, which mangles `(x86)` and spaces;
#   - cmake/msbuild are NOT in the bare PATH -> must go through VsDevCmd (vm_build.cmd does this);
#   - GUI apps launched over SSH land in session 0 (Services, no desktop) -> they don't render
#     and never reach the world. vm_s1.cmd relaunches in the interactive console session (1).

# Guard against incremental-build struct corruption: editing a widely-included
# layout header (e.g. CGameAnimation.h, pulled in transitively by most of the
# engine via CGameSprite.h) does NOT reliably recompile every transitive
# includer, leaving mixed-layout .obj files -> a by-value member past the change
# point lands at different offsets per TU -> garbage reads / crash (proven by an
# A/B/C smoke on the CGameAnimation pack(2) fix, 2026-06-20). When any header
# changed since the last successful build, force a full rebuild so every TU sees
# the same layout. Code-only (.cpp) edits keep the fast incremental path.
