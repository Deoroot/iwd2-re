"""frida_orig.py - unattended Frida trace of the ORIGINAL IWD2.exe, with a verdict.

`vm.sh smoke` does this for our build: launch it, load a save, watch for a
fault, count hits, print RESULT and exit with a code.  This is the counterpart
for the original binary -- the one we have no source for and therefore the only
place a runtime question can actually be answered.

  scripts/vm.sh trace --hooks scripts/probes/store_ownership.json --load-slot 3
  python scripts/frida_orig.py --hooks h.json --load-slot 3 --out C:\\iwd2-re\\t.jsonl

It eats the same hook table as frida_probe.py (schema in frida_hooks.py) and
adds: getting the game into a loaded save without a human, a crash handler, hit
counting, and a machine-readable verdict.

WHY IT SPAWNS RATHER THAN ATTACHES: the interesting questions are usually about
startup and load order (when does m_idLocalPlayer become 1?), and attaching to a
game that already reached the main menu has missed all of it.

HOW IT GETS INTO A SAVE, unattended, with nobody at the keyboard:

  skip the intro movies -> wait for input to go live -> dismiss the network popup
  -> calibrate the cursor map -> click Load Game -> LoadGame(slot)
  -> click Done on Character Arbitration -> world engine activated

Every click is a REAL click: the cursor is moved onto the control and the left
button is pressed, then the engine's own poll (CChitin::AsynchronousUpdate:1537)
dispatches OnLButtonDown/Up exactly as it would for a hand.  That indirection is
not decoration -- calling the handlers directly deadlocks, see the comment on the
input block in DRIVER_JS.  Each step below it is there because a measured run
failed without it; the reasons are in the comments, and none of them are guessable
from the decompile.

--load-slot is a VISIBLE ROW of the load screen, the same number our build's
--slot takes (CScreenLoad.cpp:240-246), so the two sides stay comparable.
--load-slot -1 leaves the game at the menu, for startup/menu/network traces.

NOT for our build: its addresses are a different image entirely, and the debug
build's +0xA base shift breaks Frida member reads (53fe6dccc766).  Instrument
our side with Iwd2DebugLog and diff the two logs -- docs/frida-differential-tracing.md.

Output contract (what vm.sh trace parses, and what to read by hand):
  <out>          JSONL, one record per hook hit, fsync'd per line
  <out>.status   plain lines: `loaded: ...`, `HITS <name> <n>`, `RESULT: <verdict>`
Verdicts: CLEAN 0 | CRASH 1 | NOT-LOADED 2 | NOT-EXERCISED 2.
NOT-LOADED and NOT-EXERCISED both mean "ran, proved nothing" -- exit 2, never a
silent pass (see the --hit lesson behind vm.sh smoke).

The six gotchas of a session-1 payload all apply and are handled here; they are
enumerated in frida_probe.py's docstring.  Read them before editing this file.
